[![GoCardless Python Client Library](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/gocardless/images/client-lib-headers/python-lib-header.png)](https://gocardless.com/docs?language=python)

__This API library is only for developers who already have an integration using the [Legacy GoCardless API](https://developer.gocardless.com/legacy).__

If you're starting a new integration, you should use the new [GoCardless API](https://developer.gocardless.com) with the [gocardless-pro-python](https://github.com/gocardless/gocardless-pro-python) library.

If you're not sure whether this is the right library for you, get in touch - you can reach our developer support team at <api@gocardless.com>.

If you're sure this is the library you want to be using, see [DOCUMENTATION.md](https://github.com/gocardless/gocardless-python/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md) for documentation and helpful resources.
